Excellent, Maple ‚Äî let‚Äôs lock down SPRAXXX Legal Foundation: Privacy Policy + User Agreement.

Below is the fully written legal-grade text, professionally worded but infused with SPRAXXX‚Äôs dignity-first, brotherhood-driven philosophy.
Once you approve, I can wrap both into HTML pages matching your dark house style (spraxxx.com look).

üîí SPRAXXX Privacy Policy

Effective Date: October 2025
Entity: SPRAXXX Nation, operated by Maple / SPRAXXX Network

‚∏ª

1. Overview

SPRAXXX believes privacy is not a luxury ‚Äî it‚Äôs a right.
We verify identity, not intimacy. We protect signal, not secrets.
Every verified alias is yours alone. No resale. No surveillance. No hidden analytics.

By using any SPRAXXX service (spraxxx.com, spraxxx.tv, spraxxx.ai, spraxxx.net), you consent to this Privacy Policy.

‚∏ª

2. Information We Collect

We collect only what is essential to verify and serve you:
	‚Ä¢	Verification Data: government ID images or documents (via Stripe Identity or equivalent).
	‚Ä¢	Alias & Contact: your chosen SPRAXXX alias and contact email.
	‚Ä¢	Payment Records: managed securely through Stripe; we never see full card data.
	‚Ä¢	Technical Logs: minimal connection metadata (IP, device type, timestamps) for abuse prevention.
	‚Ä¢	Communications: messages you send us, and optional content you publish.

We do not sell, trade, rent, or license any user data.
We do not use advertising trackers, cookies, or pixel beacons.

‚∏ª

3. How We Use Your Data

We use your information solely to:
	‚Ä¢	Verify identity and issue your SPRAXXX Key / alias.
	‚Ä¢	Provide and maintain services (Mail-Safe‚Ñ¢, VPN, email, receipts, chat).
	‚Ä¢	Detect misuse or fraud.
	‚Ä¢	Provide technical support and human dispute resolution.

Optional consent may be requested for beta features or publicity listings.

‚∏ª

4. Data Security

All systems use encrypted transport (TLS 1.3+), isolated servers (Sad-Black), and cryptographic verification (BLAKE3 / Ed25519).
Sensitive data is stored only in encrypted form, accessible solely to authorized personnel.
We routinely audit access and use hardware key protection where feasible.

‚∏ª

5. Human Override

If a user‚Äôs key, alias, or verification is compromised or misused,
SPRAXXX reserves the right ‚Äî through its Human Override Committee ‚Äî
to revoke, suspend, or restore credentials following a verified claim.

‚∏ª

6. Your Rights

You have the right to:
	‚Ä¢	Request copies or deletion of your stored data.
	‚Ä¢	Revoke consent or terminate your alias.
	‚Ä¢	Challenge any automated decision with a human review.
	‚Ä¢	Transfer your alias to another verified account (where applicable).

Requests: privacy@spraxxx.com

‚∏ª

7. Retention

We retain verification and transaction data only as long as required by financial or legal regulations (typically 6 years in Canada).
All other data may be anonymized or erased upon request.

‚∏ª

8. International Operations

SPRAXXX operates under Canadian law and aligns with GDPR principles.
Cross-border data transfers are handled through encrypted tunnels and verified vendors only.

‚∏ª

9. Updates

Any change to this policy will be posted on our domains and timestamped.
Continued use of SPRAXXX after updates means acceptance of new terms.
